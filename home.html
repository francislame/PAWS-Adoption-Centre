        Wildfire and Friendly Paws!

    <p id="news1-body1">
        Local pets are stepping up in a big way. “Friendly Paws,” in partnership 
        with the Red Cross, has been visiting evacuation centers to provide comfort 
        and companionship to wildfire survivors. Volunteers say the furry visitors 
        help reduce stress and lift spirits, proving that sometimes, healing comes 
        with paws and wagging tails.
    </p>
    <p id="news1-body2">
        Survivors report feeling calmer and more hopeful after spending time with 
        the furry visitors. According to Red Cross coordinators, the presence of 
        animals can significantly reduce stress, anxiety, and feelings of isolation 
        in traumatic situations.

    <p id="news1-body3">
        Friendly Paws plans to continue the program throughout the recovery period, 
        visiting shelters, hospitals, and community centers to spread joy and 
        healing. One volunteer remarked, “Sometimes, a wagging tail or a gentle 
        purr is the best medicine anyone can get.
